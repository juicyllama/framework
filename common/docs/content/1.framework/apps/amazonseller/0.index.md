### Integration

This app uses our built in [app store](../../backend/app-store/0.index.md) integration, which automates the Oauth connection between your application and your Amazon Seller App.

You will need to build your app inside your seller account and add the following environment variables:

```bash
AMAZON_SELLER_APP_ID: 'Provided once you create your amazon seller app'
AMAZON_SELLER_CLIENT_ID: 'Provided once you create your amazon seller app'
AMAZON_SELLER_CLIENT_SECRET: 'Provided once you create your amazon seller app'
#AMAZON_MARKETPLACE_ACCESS_KEY: 'AWS IAM User access key, with Amazon Marketplace API access'
#AMAZON_MARKETPLACE_SECRET: 'AWS IAM User secret key, with Amazon Marketplace API access'
```

If you would like to redirect users to a specific location after the app has been connected, you can use the environment variable:

```bash
AMAZON_SELLER_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=
```

#### App Store

The app will be automatically added to your system apps table when you import this module into your application.

Users will need to provide the following details when creating an app:

- MARKETPLACE_ID - you can find a list of [amazon marketplace id's here](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/marketplace-ids)
- SELLER_ID - Your seller partner ID, which can be found in your seller central account
