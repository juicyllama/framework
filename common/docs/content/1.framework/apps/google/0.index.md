# Google

The Google app is a wrapper around different Google APIs. It provides a consistent interface for interacting with the Google within the confines of our framework.

It comes with the added benefit of leveraging a data lake (if you have one setup) to cache the results of your api calls (saving money). Along with logging and other framework benefits.
